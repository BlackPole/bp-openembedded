# f line in cccam would be like :
# F: user pasword2 5 0 0 { 0:0:3 } { } { } cccam.example.cx
# this users c line here server line in oscam.server has group 12 to avoid loop back I did not put group 12 in his user
# account f line. Normally it's not needed... However some svn versions can have segfault errors and jumps out due to that loopback.
# By doing this you will avoid that kind of problems.That's also the reason that i asign a different group to each reader.
