Subject: [PATCH 11/69] DSS2: Allocated memory for Color Look-up-table

We were not allocating memory for CMAP buffer and due to that
G_CMAP was failing, since it does check for size of CMAP buffer.

Called "fb_alloc_cmap" for llocating memory for CMAP.

We are currently not supporting 1,2,4,8 bpp, so meaning less
for us as of now. But for completeness this is required.
