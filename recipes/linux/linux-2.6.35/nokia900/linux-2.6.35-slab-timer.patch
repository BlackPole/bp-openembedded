Subject: [PATCH] slab: use deferred timers for its periodic housekeeping

slab has a "once every 2 second" timer for its housekeeping.
As the number of logical processors is growing, its more and more
common that this 2 second timer becomes the primary wakeup source.

This patch turns this housekeeping timer into a deferred timer,
which means that the timer does not interrupt idle, but just runs
at the next event that wakes the cpu up.

The impact is that the timer likely runs a bit later, but during the
delay no code is running so there's not all that much reason for
a difference in housekeeping to occur because of this delay.
